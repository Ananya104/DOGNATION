                <h4>Big woofers, smol floofs … we love puppers of all kinds.</h4>
                Every year, approximately 6.5 million pets enter animal shelters nationwide, and 1.5 million become euthanized.
                
                And with the current shelter crisis, numbers are on the rise. But you can help!

               Not only are pets scientifically proven to reduce stress levels and improve blood pressure,
                but no one can offer the unconditional love and companionship a pet can.
               
               We are a non profit organization working for the betterment of street dogs.Our mission is to ensure that every lil one of the street finds a home,is catered to and given loads of loversand affection.

               <p class="para-content">We established DogNation back in 2012 with just a team of 5 volunteers.Initial periods were tough 
                 but we soon managed to gather support , thanks to the contributions  of avid animal lovers. Over the period of last decade, we have managed 
                 to rescue approximately 3000 dogs, providing them a home they deserve.
        
               </p>

   Our vision as an organisation for the future is to expand our centers to even more places, reach out to more 
   and more animals and rescue as many as possible.In addition,our organization is dedicated 
   to the prevention of cruelty to animals. The purpose is to fund  programs and to provide education for responsible pet ownership. 
   It is estimated that there are over 12 millions dogs and cats in the streets.So, we are always in search for more and 
   more volunteers to fund our initiaves and also, to adopt the rescued dogs!

                       Buying a pet is not cheap.And that does not include the cost of neuter or vaccinations. Adoption fees in min and often include all those post-adoption amenities. A bargain when you consider you’ll be bringing home the companion of a lifetime!</p>

   <h3>WE HELP YOU WITH THE PROCESS</h3>
  <p class="mid-content">Adopting from a shelter would be a great choice for anyone, especially If 
    you are a first-time pet parent or have little experience  with animals. This is because shelters 
    will guide you through the process and will also provide you with all the information you need, 
    making it easier for you to take care of your adopted pet.</p>

                      <p class="mid-content">There’s a reason why they are called a man’s best friend. With a life that might not last as long as the man, they definitely give us memories that we cherish forever. When you adopt a stray dog, you’re giving it more than just a space to live in; you are making all its hardships go away. Such a dog loves you even more for making its life better.</p>
